# TODO: have the script clone down the "ansible/dotfiles" dir (including the vaulted private keys) and begin work so that when using on a fresh install, user only has to perform the following tasks:
# sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
# curl https://www.raw.github.com/jackrmcshane/ansible/bin/dotfiles | bash
# 
# and everything will work as intended
#
# have to outline what the dir structure will look like:
# ansible
#   |-> bin/
#   |-> keys/
#   |-> tasks/
#   |-> README.md
#   |-> main.yml
# .config
#   |-> nvim
#         .
#         .
#   |-> shell

# set vars
SSH_DIR="$HOME/.ssh"
DOTFILES_DIR="$HOME/.dotfiles"

# install ansible if not installed
if ! [ -x "$(command -v ansible)" ]; then
  sudo apt install -y ansible

# ansible will install or upgrade any packages in requirements.yml
